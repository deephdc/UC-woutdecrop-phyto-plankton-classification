## Installing this module

### Local installation

> **Requirements**
>
> This project has been tested in Ubuntu 18.04 with Python 3.6.9. Further package requirements are described in the
> `requirements.txt` file.
> - It is a requirement to have [Tensorflow>=2.3.3 installed](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip) (either in gpu 
> or cpu mode). This is not listed in the `requirements.txt` as it [breaks GPU support](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7166). 
> - Run `python -c 'import cv2'` to check that you installed correctly the `opencv-python` package (sometimes
> [dependencies are missed](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47113029/importerror-libsm-so-6-cannot-open-shared-object-file-no-such-file-or-directo) in `pip` installations).

To start using this framework clone the repo and download the [default weights](https://api.cloud.ifca.es:8080/swift/v1/imagenet-tf/default_imagenet.tar.xz):

```bash
# First line installs OpenCV requirement
apt-get update && apt-get install -y libgl1
git clone https://github.com/lifewatch/phyto-plankton-classification
cd phyto-plankton-classification
pip install -e .
curl -o ./models/default_imagenet.tar.xz https://api.cloud.ifca.es:8080/swift/v1/imagenet-tf/default_imagenet.tar.xz #create share link from nextcloud
cd models && tar -xf default_imagenet.tar.xz && rm default_imagenet.tar.xz
```
now run DEEPaaS:
```
deepaas-run --listen-ip 0.0.0.0
```
and open http://0.0.0.0:5000/ui and look for the methods belonging to the `planktonclas` module.

### Install through Docker

#### 1.1 Install docker
Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/). 

#### 1.2 Run docker
Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system before executing the DEEP-OC Phytoplankton Classification module using Docker containers.
So open docker, if correct, you should see a small ship (docker desktop) symbol running on the bottom right of your windows screen

#### 1.3 Clone the directory
The directory is cloned so that the remote and the local directory are the same. This makes it easier to copy files inside the remote directory
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lifewatch/phyto-plankton-classification
cd phyto-plankton-classification
```

#### 1.4 Run the docker container inside the local folder

After docker is installed and running, you can run the ready-to-use [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/deephdc/uc-lifewatch-deep-oc-phyto-plankton-classification) to
run this module. To run it:

##### option 1
Run container and activate acess to nextcloud server through rclone.

If you rclone the credentials (see [Tutorial](https://docs.ai4eosc.eu/en/latest/user/howto/rclone.html#configuring-rclone)) from the [NEXTCLOUD](https://share.services.ai4os.eu/index.php/apps/dashboard/) server, you can also create a direct link to these credentials through one line of code. 

First, install it directly on your machine:
```bash
$ curl -O https://downloads.rclone.org/v1.62.2/rclone-v1.62.2-linux-amd64.deb
$ apt install ./rclone-v1.62.2-linux-amd64.deb
$ rm rclone-current-linux-amd64.deb
```

Secondly, run 'rclone config'
```bash
$ rclone config
choose "n"  for "New remote"
choose name for DEEP-Nextcloud --> rshare
choose "Type of Storage" --> Webdav
provide DEEP-Nextcloud URL for webdav access --> https://data-deep.a.incd.pt/remote.php/webdav/
choose Vendor --> Nextcloud
specify "user" --> (see `<user>` in "Configuring rclone" above).
password --> y (Yes type in my own password)
specify "password" --> (see `<password>` in "Configuring rclone" above).
bearer token --> ""
Edit advanced config? --> n (No)
Remote config --> y (Yes this is OK)
Current remotes --> q (Quit config)
```

After installing rclone and running 'rclone config'. The rclone.conf page should look like this: 
```bash
[rshare]
type = webdav
url = https://data-deep.a.incd.pt/remote.php/webdav/
vendor = nextcloud
user = ***some-username***
pass = ***some-userpassword**  --> this is equivalent to `rclone obscure <password>`
```
Copy the location to the rclone.config location and apply the line of code

```bash
docker run -ti -p 8888:8888 -p 5000:5000 -v "LOCATION/rclone.conf:/root/.config/rclone/rclone.conf" -v "$(pwd):/srv/phyto-plankton-classification" deephdc/uc-lifewatch-deep-oc-phyto-plankton-classification:latest /bin/bash
```

Now open http://0.0.0.0:5000/ui and look for the methods belonging to the `planktonclas` module.

##### option 2
Run container and only have local access
All files can be locally saved but rclone needs to be configured after activation to acces nextcloud server, follow [Tutorial](https://docs.ai4eosc.eu/en/latest/user/howto/rclone.html#configuring-rclone)
```bash
docker run -ti -p 8888:8888 -p 5000:5000 -v "$(pwd):/srv/phyto-plankton-classification" deephdc/uc-lifewatch-deep-oc-phyto-plankton-classification:latest /bin/bash
```
Now open http://0.0.0.0:5000/ui and look for the methods belonging to the `planktonclas` module.

> **Tip**: Rclone can also be configured after activation to acces nextcloud server, follow [Tutorial](https://docs.ai4eosc.eu/en/latest/user/howto/rclone.html#configuring-rclone).



## Train the phyto-plankton-classifier

You can train your own audio classifier with your custom dataset. For that you have to:

### 1. Data preprocessing

The first step to train you image classifier if to have the data correctly set up. 

#### 1.1 Prepare the images

The model needs to be able to access the images. So you have to place your images in the`./data/images` folder. If you have your data somewhere else you can use that location by setting the `image_dir` parameter in the training args. 
Please use a standard image format (like `.png` or `.jpg`). 

You can copy the images to 'phyto-plankton-classification/data/images' folder on your pc. 
If the images are on nextcloud, you can one of the next steps depending if you have rclone or not. 

##### option 1: follow-up (you haver rclone)

If you followed [option 1](#option-1), you can rclone your data from nextcloud. This will be the fastest way.

```bash
rclone copy /storage/some/remote/path /storage/local/path
rclone copy /storage/Imagine_UC5/data/images /srv/phyto-plankton-classification/data/images
```

##### option 2: follow-up

If you followed [option 2](#option-2) and don't have rclone credentials, you can change the images_directory in the config file. You can for example change so so it points to the nextcloud directory. By doing so, you don't need to copy the files but it will take a bit longer to compute.

You can change the config file directly as shown below, or you can change it when running the api.

```bash
  images_directory:
    value: "/storage/Imagine_UC5/data/images"
    type: "str"
    help: >
          Base directory for images. If the path is relative, it will be appended to the package path.
```


#### 1.2 Prepare the data splits (optional)

Next, you need add to the `./data/dataset_files` directory the following files:

| *Mandatory files* | *Optional files*  | 
|:-----------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  `classes.txt`, `train.txt` |  `val.txt`, `test.txt`, `info.txt`,`aphia_ids.txt`|

The `train.txt`, `val.txt` and `test.txt` files associate an image name (or relative path) to a label number (that has
to *start at zero*).
The `classes.txt` file translates those label numbers to label names.
The `aphia_ids.txt` file translates those the classes to their corresponding aphia_ids.
Finally the `info.txt` allows you to provide information (like number of images in the database) about each class. 

You can find examples of these files at  `./data/demo-dataset_files`.

If you don't want to create your own datasplit, this will be done automatically for you with a 80% train, 10% validation, and 10% test split.

### 2. Train the classifier

> **Tip**: Training is usually depend on the training args you use. Although the default ones work reasonable well,
> you can explore how to modify them with the [dataset exploration notebook](./notebooks/1.0-Dataset_exploration.ipynb).

There are two options two train:
#### option 1: train through api
Go to http://0.0.0.0:5000/ui and look for the ``TRAIN`` POST method. Click on 'Try it out', change whatever training args
you want and click 'Execute'. The training will be launched and you will be able to follow its status by executing the 
``TRAIN`` GET method which will also give a history of all trainings previously executed.

You can follow the training monitoring (Tensorboard) on http://0.0.0.0:6006.
#### option 2: Follow the notebooks 
Follow the notebook for [Model training](./notebooks/2.0-Model_training) and train the [train_runfile.py](./plankton/train_runfile.py)  based on [yaml file](/etc/config.yaml) file.
```bash
python phyto-plankton-classification/planktonclas/train_runfile.py 
```
## Test an image classifier
There are again two options to predict a plankton species:

#### option 1: train through api
Go to http://0.0.0.0:5000/ui and look for the `PREDICT` POST method. Click on 'Try it out', change whatever test args
you want and click 'Execute'. You can **either** supply a:

* a `data` argument with a path pointing to an image.

OR
* a `url` argument with an URL pointing to an image.
  Here is an [example](https://forum.mikroscopia.com/uploads/monthly_07_2017/post-2056-0-71322100-1501364951_thumb.jpg) of such an url that you can use for testing purposes.

#### option 2: Follow the notebooks 
Follow the notebook for [computing the predictions](./notebooks/3.0-Computing_predictions.ipynb)
Make sure to select DEMO or not if you want to predict your own data of the demo data as an example.


## More info

You can have more info on how to interact directly with the module (not through the DEEPaaS API) by examining the 
``./notebooks`` folder:

* [dataset exploration notebook](./notebooks/1.0-Dataset_exploration.ipynb):
  Visualize relevant statistics that will help you to modify the training args.
* [Image transformation notebook](./notebooks/1.1-Image_transformation.ipynb):
  To conform a new dataset with the training set that was used
* [Image transformation notebook](./notebooks/1.2-Image_augmentation):
  Notebook to perform image augmentation and expand the dataset.
*[Model training notebook](./notebooks/2.0-Model_training):
  Notebook to perform image augmentation and expand the dataset.
* [computing predictions notebook](./notebooks/3.0-Computing_predictions.ipynb):
  Test the classifier on a number of tasks: predict a single local image (or url), predict multiple images (or urls),
  merge the predictions of a multi-image single observation, etc.

<!-- <img src="./reports/figures/predict.png" alt="predict" width="400"> -->

* [predictions statistics notebook](./notebooks/3.1-Prediction_statistics.ipynb):
  Make and store the predictions of the `test.txt` file (if you provided one). Once you have done that you can visualize
  the statistics of the predictions like popular metrics (accuracy, recall, precision, f1-score), the confusion matrix, etc.



Finally you can [launch a simple webpage](./planktonclas/webpage/README.md) to use the trained classifier to predict images (both local and urls) on your favorite browser.
